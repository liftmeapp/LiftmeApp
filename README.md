This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

   The BookingModal and accepting the booking and when clicking the bookingCard does not function inside the  @app/\(root\)/\(tabs\)/settings/add-business/tow-truck-dashboard.tsx  but  it does work coorectly inside @app/\(root\)/\(tabs\)/settings/add-business/garage-dashboard.tsx  and I want to have the same features and details there, and the card to function correctly like it does in garage dashboard. Like the booking card should have same details in the modal and the card like it does in garage dashboard, and inside towtruck it should show the pickup location as well as the destination and the distance between them and stuff. CAn you do that?
